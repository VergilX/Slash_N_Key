# About our Project
Our project is aimed at improving the garbage collection system based on localities in a region. What we are looking for a community of people who are ready to contribute towards the maintenance and cleanliness of their own surroundings and society. We facilitate this by building a machine learning model that is able to detect waste. This machine learning model is installed in the AI cameras that are present on the roadways. So, effectively, there is very less expense. 

The AI cameras scan the area and detect the waste. For the involvement of the community, we provide a website in which interested people can volunteer to register. When registering, the user has to provide details few personal details, including your phone number (which will be used to send SMS notifications). When the threshold pollution has been passed, all the people in a particular community area are informed about the location of the waste and level of pollution. 

The volunteers are then encouraged to get together and clean the garbage. This way, people living in the area are responsible for the cleanliness of their own surroundings. This way, our products help to keep the society clean.
